The function of this program is to read any number of entries for cars written
in a file "cars.txt" in the form "make,model,year,color".  The program works
as functions, but may have errors if blank lines are left at the end of the
text file.

NOTES ABOUT PROGRAM FUNCTION:

	1. DO NOT add any blank lines/whitespace to the cars.txt file.  An extra blank
line after the end of the text causes a segmentation fault.
