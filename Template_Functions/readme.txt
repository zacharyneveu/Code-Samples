This program uses three classes: one stores prices of items in a big
purchase (integer dollar amounts), one stores prices of small items
(floating point dollar amounts), and one stores the names of items in a
purchase (string data).  A purchase of each type is then created, and a
single template function is used to find the maximum value for each
purchase (sorting the numbers numerically, and the strings
alphabetically).  Another template function is used to find the sum of all
values in each purchase.

NOTES ABOUT PROGRAM FUNCTION:
