This program is an object oriented version of the linked list program created
previously.  This program uses two classes: list and node.  The list class
stores the head of the list and all of the functions that operate at the list
level.  The node class includes the data and next pointers of each node, as
well as the functions to set and get the data and next values.

NOTES ABOUT PROGRAM FUNCTION:
	1. Delete with value function is ommitted in this implementation because
it was an optional function in the original program, and had persistent bugs
that had not been worked out.
	2. This program does not need any arguments.
